#DRINKELLO

**Version 1.0**

Web Application using Firebase to display recipes for cocktails. It gives an option to find random recipe and search by name or alcohol type.


#### Motivation
I created this app during workshop at Coders Lab course. It was my final project for Javascript Developer: React course graduation.

#### Technologies
* Create React App
* SASS
* Firebase


#### Bugs
* Mobile menu is not closing after clicking a link.
* Get Random Recipe option is not working when being on page with recipe for specific drink.

**Project is in Progress**
I'm currently learning Redux to fix bugs.
Also new features will be added
